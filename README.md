# midi-mpv

Control [MPV](https://mpv.io/) via midi.

Trigger playlist clips, (un)pause, seek to positions, change speed, etc.

Use the expressive power of Clojure to map midi events (note-on, control-change, etc) to any MPV commands you like.

You can control multiple MPV instances (by routing commands to distinct sockets).

Refer to [sample mappers](sample-mappers) to get an idea of the midi mapping possibilities.
